    You can pass a list of site labels to bypass being prompted for which sites
    to #{command}.  The site labels should start with the "unique_names" specified in the

    E.g. to #{command} the Accounts and Exchange sites, you could type

    As a shortcut, you can also pass 'all' to #{command} all of the sites, e.g.

  def tutorial
say <<-TUTORIAL

The 'swerve' program lets you easily download and run the sites in the
OpenStax family.

To get started, you first need to download the sites.

#{prompt('swerve download')}

This will prompt you with a list of the sites, letting you choose which you want
to download.  Choose the one called #{@@sites[0].name}.  See the "Shortcut" column?  
Most of the commands in swerve let you specify shortcuts for sites on the command 
line.  For example you could have said

#{prompt('swerve download ' + @@sites[0].unique_label)}

to have just downloaded the #{@@sites[0].name} site without being prompted to choose.

  ----------------------
  Aside: For whichever sites are chosen for downloading, all of the code repositories
  for that site will be downloaded.  There is one main repository for each site 
  (called the "origin") and then each developer has their own copy of the code.  By 
  default, the "origin" repository is the active repository for each site.  Any 
  site-specific actions you take (like starting the web server) run on that site's 
  active repository.  Sometimes, you'll want to look at code in a different repository, 
  and possibly even on a different branch.  To do this, use the #{tut('swerve repo')} and 
  #{tut('swerve branch')} commands.
  ----------------------

After you have downloaded the #{@@sites[0].name} site, take a moment to look at swerve's
status:

#{prompt('swerve status')}

This will print a table showing the status of the sites available in swerve.  Along with
the name of the site, the table shows the active repository, the active branch, and the port
of the site's server if it is online (saying '(offline)' if it is offline).  Downloaded
sites show up in green, non-downloaded ones in red.

Before a particular site can be run, it must be initialized.  To do that for the one we 
downloaded:

#{prompt('swerve init ' + @@sites[0].unique_label)}

You'll likely only want to initialize every so often.  Initialization does things like
deleting and resetting your sites' development databases.  Then to start the server:

#{prompt('swerve start ' + @@sites[0].unique_label)}

In the status table, you'll now see two ports listed for #{@@sites[0].name}.  The first is
the port used inside the swerve virtual machine.  The second is the port that is available
outside of the virtual machine.  Say this second port was 30000.  Then on your computer you
could point a browser to #{tut("http://localhost:30000")} and voila you'd see the site for
#{@@sites[0].name}.

To stop or restart the server, use the following, respectively:

#{prompt('swerve stop')}
#{prompt('swerve restart')}

If someone has developed some new code and you want to make it available to your installation
of swerve, you can do

#{prompt('swerve update')}

At any time you can say:

#{prompt('swerve help')}

to get a summary of the available commands.  Passing a command to #{tut('swerve help')} will
give you detailed help on that command, e.g.:

#{prompt('swerve help start')}

    Deletes the specified sites.  If you don't have any unpushed work in the sites,
    deleting them is no biggie -- you can just redownload them.  

    Note that when you destroy the Swerve virtual machine (via "vagrant destroy") the
    sites in swerve are not deleted.  This is because they are actually stored in the
    "swerve" directory you checked out from Github.  So if you want to delete them,
    you have to either call this "swerve delete" command or you have to manually delete
    them from the "swerve" directory on your machine.
